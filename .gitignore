# Minimal, professional .gitignore for Unity projects
# Keeps source (`Assets/`, `ProjectSettings/`, `Packages/`) in Git while ignoring
# build artifacts, caches, local editor/user files, and platform-specific outputs.

# === Unity generated folders ===
# Library contains imported assets and platform caches - do NOT track
Library/
# Temp and Obj are transient build/temp folders
Temp/
Obj/

# Builds and generated player output - don't commit binary builds
Build/
Builds/
*.apk
*.aab
*.unitypackage

# User-specific files (IDE/editor)
UserSettings/

# Visual Studio / MonoDevelop / Rider files
*.csproj
*.unityproj
*.sln
*.suo
*.tmp
*.user
*.userprefs
*.pidb
*.booproj
*.svd

# Rider
.idea/
*.sln.iml

# VS Code workspace/local settings
.vscode/

# OS generated files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
desktop.ini

# Logs
*.log

# Package caches (Unity keeps package caches in Library)
Library/PackageCache/
Library/PackageManager/

# Crash dumps and debug symbols
crash.dmp
*.pdb
*.mdb

# Unity generated asset bundles and temp artifacts
*.unitypackage

# Recommended tracked folders (do not ignore):
# - Assets/ (game assets and scripts)
# - ProjectSettings/ (project configuration)
# - Packages/ (package manifest)

# Notes:
# - This is intentionally minimal: it ignores generated, user-specific, and build outputs
#   while keeping all source content. If you use Git LFS for large binary assets (textures,
#   audio, models), add a `.gitattributes` and track those filetypes with LFS.
